Target Transformation in Machine Learning Research on Graduate Admission 2 dataset

README

Introduction

This repository contains the code and results for a research project investigating the impact of target transformation on machine learning model performance. The goal was to explore the effects of converting the target column from probabilities to numerical values and back for evaluation.

Methodology

- Data Preprocessing: The target column was transformed from probabilities to numerical values using various methods (e.g., scaling, normalization).
- Model Training: Machine learning models were trained on the transformed data.
- Evaluation: Model performance was evaluated on the transformed data and then converted back to probabilities for proper interpretation.

Results

- Improved model performance (R-squared, RMSE, MSE, MAE) was observed after target transformation.
- The transformation was essential for proper evaluation and interpretation of the results.

Conclusion

Transforming target columns from probabilities to numerical values and back enhances model performance and ensures accurate evaluation, making it a crucial step in machine learning tasks.
